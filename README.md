## HELMo English Vocabulary Game

A classmate made a program using what they have seen in class. But his code was... hum horrible and it was in the console.
So I decided to make it as a game using the same concepts but with a different approach.
Using interfaces, and components.
Of course instead of him I have published a .JAR file to make it easier to use.

## How to use

1. Go in the releases section and download the latest release.

2. You'll need the Java VM (Version 17 or higher). I recommend you to use [JRE](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre).

3. Then run the .JAR file. Enjoy !
